SCOUT: Good Morning.
OWNER: Good morning, Sir. Welcome to the National Cheese Emporium!
SCOUT: Ah, thank you, my good man.
OWNER: What can I do for you, Sir?
SCOUT: Well, I was, uh, sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through "Scouting For Boys" by Robert Stephenson Smythe Baden-Powell, and I suddenly came over all peckish.
OWNER: Peckish, sir?
SCOUT: Esuriant.
OWNER: Eh?
SCOUT: 'Ee, Ah wor 'ungry-loike!
OWNER: Ah, hungry!
SCOUT: In a nutshell. And I thought to myself, "a little fermented curd will do the trick," so, I curtailed my Scouting activites, sallied forth, and infiltrated your place of purveyance to negotiate the vending of some cheesy comestibles!
OWNER: Come again?
SCOUT: I want to buy some cheese.
OWNER: Oh, I thought you were complaining about the bazouki player!
SCOUT: Oh, heaven forbid: I am one who delights in all manifestations of the Terpsichorean muse!
OWNER: Sorry?
SCOUT: 'Ooo, Ah lahk a nice tuune, 'yer forced too!
OWNER: So he can go on playing, can he?
SCOUT: Most certainly! Now then, some cheese please, my good man.
OWNER: (lustily) Certainly, sir. What would you like?
SCOUT: Well, eh, how about a little red Leicester.
OWNER: I'm, a-fraid we're fresh out of red Leicester, sir.
SCOUT: Oh, never mind, how are you on Tilsit?
OWNER: I'm afraid we never have that at the end of the week, sir, we get it fresh on Monday.
SCOUT: Tish tish. No matter. Well, stout yeoman, four ounces of Caerphilly, if you please.

OWNER: Yes,sir.
SCOUT: Really?
(pause)
OWNER: No. Not really, sir.
